Operators:
    Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition,
    subtractions we can compare things if two entities are same or not if a number is grater
    the other or not. There are three types of operators. They are Arithmetic operators,
    Relational operators and logical operators.

Arithmetic Operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions,
    subtractions etc.
    + --> Addition
    - --> Substration
    / --> Division
    * --> Multiplication
    % --> Modulus, remainder

Relational Operators.
    Relational Operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. For example if
    something is bigger than other thing or if two numbers are same or not or if two boolean
    variables contain same values or not

    == --> used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true
            otherwise we get false.
    != --> used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. We get a true if they
             are not same.
    >  --> used to check if one value is greater than other value or not if greater we get a true
    <  --> opposite of > used to check if the value on the left is smaller than the value
            on right side we will get a true.
    >= --> if the values on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same
            we will get a true.
    <= --> it opposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to
            other thing

Conditional constructions
Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition
is true that java execute the code otherwise it skips that code.

How to write IfElse condition:
    if(condition){
    any line of code

    if(){
    }

    }

Important Notes:
    1) For String we use equals method instead of == sign because it's a  non-primitive data type
    2) We can ctrl+alt+l to format out code.
    3) If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to
        to check the other part.
