Constructor - block of code similar to a method
that is executed when we create an Object.

Why do we need it? - constructor initializes the object

How to create a constructor?
1. Constructor name MUST be same as a class
2. No return type

Type of the constructors:
non argument
parametrized

this keyword - is used to refer to the CURRENT object

this. can be used with variables and methods

    this. used to refer to CURRENT the instance variables
    In situation when local variable have same name as instance -> we use this. to differentiate
    and refer to the instance variable

    this can be used to refer to the CURRENT instance methods as well

this() -can use to call CURRENT class constructor

Katy Writing:

Can I use this() keyword and super() keyword in the same constructor

It's a no no
you cannot use both this() and super() in the same constructor in Java.
A constructor can either invoke a constructor of the same class using this(),
or invoke a constructor of the parent class using super(), but not both.

This is because this() and super() must be the first statements in a constructor,
and only one of them can be used. If both are used in the same constructor,
it would result in a compile-time error.
