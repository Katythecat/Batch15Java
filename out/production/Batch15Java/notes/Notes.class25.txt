Can I do a constructor in Interface and abstract

In Java, you can define constructors in classes that implement interfaces,
but not in interfaces themselves. However, abstract classes can have constructors.

Interfaces are a special type of class that only define abstract methods and constants,
but do not provide any implementation. Since interfaces do not define any implementation,
it does not make sense to have a constructor in an interface.

On the other hand, abstract classes can have constructors,
and they are often used to initialize the state of the class
or to provide a common implementation for subclasses.
When a subclass is created, the constructor of the abstract class is called first,
followed by the constructor of the subclass.
