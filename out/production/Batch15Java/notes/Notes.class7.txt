What is loop?
Loop is a concept which allow to run certain block of code multiple times

Why it is important?
1. We use loop for repetitive execution
2. avoid code redundancy
3. Time-consuming process is reduced

Loop
1. while loop

while(condition)
{
loop body;
increment/decrement;
}

2. do...while loop
When to use do...while loop-when we need to repeat the statement block at least one time

do
{
 statement;
 increment/decrement;
}while(condition);

3. for loop
When to use for loop - if number of iteration is fixed
for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement){
         statement
         }

         or

for(start value;endValue;increment/decrement){
        statement
        }



While Loop:
    They help us repeat code.
Why should we use while loops:
    Because manually copying and pasting is very bad,
     and it's not scalable. They also help us reduce the number of lines of
     code that we have to type
Syntax WhileLoop:
    while (condition){
    code that we want to repeat
    }

Operator
1. pre increment (++a) -> increment a by 1 then use new value of a to implement
2. post increment (a++) -> use a current of a to implement and then increment a by 1
