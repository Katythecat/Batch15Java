Visually simplified.

Boxing:
   It is the process of converting primitive data types to its corresponding wrapper type or object type.
Integer i = new Integer (10)    => Boxing
int one = I;                                   => Unboxing

AutoBoxing:
   It says that we just have to assign a wrapper type to a primitive type of variable and conversion will happen automatically.
Character gf = ‘a’;     => Autoboxing
char ch = gf;               => Auto-unboxing
