Logical Operators:
    Logical Operators allow us to combine multiple conditions. They only
    work with boolean(true,false) values. There are three logical Operators
    1) !,||,&&
Why should we use Logical Operators:
    1) The can greatly simplify the logic.
    2) It helps us reduce the lines of code that we have to write.
NOT(!):
    it reverses the conditions. if something is true it will make it false
    and if something is false it will make it true.
    System.out.println(!true) => false
Logical OR Operator(||):
    it can combine two or more than two conditions and returns true as long as
    there is one condition is true. if all the conditions becomes false
    it returns us a false.
Logical AND(&&):
    it can also combine two or more conditions. it only returns true if all the
    conditions are true.

Switch case
int day=3;

switch(day){
case 1 : "Monday";

rules
1.The value of the case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch

Limitations of switch statement
1. cannot use with operators--> relational and logical
2. cannot use with boolean float double long as an arguments in switch()
